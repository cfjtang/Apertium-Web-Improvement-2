TRANSLATOR

You need apertium-2.0 and lttoolbox-2.0 to use this translator.  To compile
the linguistical data simply do:

make

inside of this directory.


TAGGER

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the pt-gl and the gl-pt translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonably way.
