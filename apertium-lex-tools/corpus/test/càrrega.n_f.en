247682	Always on flat ground a layer of gravel or balast is placed which distributes the load and levels the road.
68793	An electrical field was produced when the charge was stationary with respect to an observer that measured the properties of the charge; and a magnetic field (also an electrical field) was produced when the charge moved (creating an electrical current) with respect to the observer.
82509	The designs employed for these aircraft are very slim and have very long wings and a very high wing surface in relation to the load that they bear.
272005	Static electricity is an important element in the biological process of entomogamic pollination by bees, as the charge of the body of the bees helps to attract and retain the pollen.
612721	This makes the design of the launcher simpler, by not needing multiple starters, and the penalty is very small for the most usual mission that is the one to bring loads into geostationary orbit given that the launch ramp in French Guyana is very near the equator.
358681	In addition, the allies had more than one thousand broken supply lorries, and troop transports were used to substitute them.
419287	From the reservoir of Mojaisk it is increased by the load of residual industrial fluids.
x150301	Each element of the oxidant-reductor couple is related to one of the two electrodes that in being connected to a consumer of electricity cause the circulation of an electrical current, the resultant chemical reaction causes a circulation of charge (electrons, ions between the electrodes through the external circuit connected.
115787	Benjamin Franklin investigated with Leiden bottles and was able to show that the charge was stored in the glass and not in the water as had been thought until then.
21589	An ion with positive charge is called a cation, and anion is an ion with negative charge.
