Spanish--Catalan

You need apertium-3.0 and lttoolbox-3.0 to use this translator.  To compile
the linguistic data simply do:

./configure
make
make install

inside of this directory.

Spanish--Catalan with economy vocabulary

To compile using the economy vocabulary (entries with "eco" tag in the dictionaries), type:
cp Makefile.am.eco Makefile.am
./autogen.sh
make 
sudo make install

If you had the standard linguistic data already installed, or if some error occurs in compilation, you should type:

cp Makefile.am.eco Makefile.am
sudo make distclean
./autogen.sh
make 
sudo make install


TAGGER 

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the ca-es and the es-ca translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonably way.

If for some reason you need to retrain the tagger (for example, you
have made really extensive changes to the dictionaries such as
creating new lexical categories), please see the documentation
on our Wiki:
