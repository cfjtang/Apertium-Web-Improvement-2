A Few Words About Automatic Translation

The idea of translating texts from one language to another using a computer is almost as old as the computer itself. In the course of the cold war Allied secret service workers hoped the computer to replace qualified spies in translating secret Russian documents into English. Even though translation of documents becomes a reality today, the vision of an international conference without human translators seems as distant as it was half a century ago.

With years, linguists, philologists, and computer scientists verified their expectations from an automatic translator and simultaneously tried to alter the attitude of users. Both parties came to the conclusion that the computer cannot translate Shakespeare, Joyce, nor Wharton. It is not able to translate even a simple joke. Automatic translation is not applicable in the case of translation of literary texts, it is, however, adequate when dealing with professional texts from  specific, preferably narrowed, domains. 

In the case of texts from general domain the computer may only help man establish the subject matter of a text, or do the hard work that boils down to the specification of most appropriate equivalents in  particular contexts. It can also order them in the most probable linguistic units. Nevertheless, the task of the ultimate establishment of meaning still depends on man.


Direct Translation

The easiest fashion of translating texts is the substitution of a words of a source language with respective equivalents from a target language. Setting aside the fact that as early as in '60 it was acknowledged that the method is unreliable, systems of automatic translation that rely on it are still being developed. This method is applied in the majority of translating systems available on the Polish market.

Transfer-Based Translation

The most widespread method incorporated in the automatic translation systems around the world is the transfer method. It comprises the following:
• dictionary;
• text representation;
• grammar;
• syntax analysis.


Dictionary

The most laborious part in the process of developing an automatic translation system is the compilation of its dictionary. The description of a dictionary data should meet the following requirements:
• the description must be compatible with the translation algorithm,
• the coverage of dictionary should be as complete as possible,
• entries of the dictionary should be elaborated in as much detail as possible;
The simultaneous fulfilment of the conditions mentioned above is not straightforward, and the compilation of a 'decent' dictionary is time-consuming. That is why automatic translation systems most of the times rely heavily on a vocabulary from a limited domain only.


Text Representation

A pivotal stage in a translation is the manner of presenting an analysed section (most frequently a sentence) in the form that can be then transferred to a representation of a target sentence. The Phrase Structure and the Relation Tree are the two most commonly found representation methods.
The former is the traditional fashion of presenting the structure of a sentence. The Polish sentence 'Zły wilk goni słabą owieczkę' is structured as follows:


The tree represents the following organizational pattern: The sentence comprises the nominal and the verb phrase. The nominal phrase comprises the adjective 'zły' and the noun 'wilk'. The verb phrase comprises the verb 'goni' and the sub-structure: the nominal phrase. The sub-structure of the nominal phrase is constituted by the adjective 'słabą' and the noun 'owieczkę'.

In the tree structure approach it is assumed that every word (with the exception of the predicate verb) in a sentence is dependent on another one. The tree represents this dependence. An example of a sentence represented by the means of a relation tree structure is shown below:

Figure 3. An example of the relation tree

The subject of the activity ('pies') and the object of the activity ('mysz') depend on the verb. Adjectives determining the noun ('duży' and 'wściekłą') depend on the respective nouns ('pies' and 'mysz'). It is not always easy to determine relationship between individual components -- related words do not have to be adjacent. The sentence 'Słabą goni wilk zły owieczkę', for instance, may be presented using the tree structure from Figure 3. The dependence between the adjective 'słabą' and the noun 'owieczkę' is established on the premises of case, gender, and number agreement of both words.


Grammar

Having determined the manner of representation of a text it becomes necessary to establish a method of such a representation. Most often this task comprises of grammar description and syntax analysis of a text. By the notion of grammar a number of rules that specify how correct sentence structures can be formed is understood. Additionally, grammar may contain information about the structure of sentences formed on the basis of those rules.

Grammar is a mathematical attempt to delineate linguistic processes that are reluctant to subdue to mathematical formalisation. As for now, no formal representation of a language have been developed that would encompass all possible constructions. In other words, no matter the level of advancement of a grammar description, man can produce a sentence the structure of which has not been included in this description.


Syntax Analysis

The process of verification of compatibility between a text and a grammar description is called syntax analysis. Its outcome is both to affirm whether a particular sentence agrees with the grammar description (a sentence that meets such requirements is correct) and to yield a sentence structure in a given representational method (e.g. in a tree structure). In the case of automatic translation it is vital that the syntax analysis yields representational schemata also for sentences that do not agree with the grammar description.


Transfer

A text representation that has been syntactically analysed then undergoes transfer. In TRANSLATICA this stage entails transformation of a syntactical structure of a source language into a respective tree structure in a target language. Both representations can be compared by using the option of translating with the display of tree structure (button ) 


Generating Translation

The last stage of the transfer-based method of translation is generating a translated text on the basis of the previously obtained representation. At this stage one has to be mindful of a specific word order in a given language and of the manner of inflecting words.

Main Features of TRANSLATICA

The History of Development

The TRANSLATICA system was developed between 1996 and 2002 as the POLENG system that translated only from Polish into English. It originated at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, with the help of The State Committee for Scientific Research (between 1999 and 2000), Polish Phonetic Association (between 1996 and 2001), and Allied Irish Bank (2002).

The TRANSLATICA system originated in the year 2004, when, on the basis of the previously developed translation techniques on the one hand and the lexicon based on the PWN-Oxford English-Polish Dictionary, the function of translating from English into Polish was added.
In 2005 the new edition of TRANSLATICA was published. It included a broader dictionary of words and phrases, larger sets of transfer rules and integration with a wider range of office application.


TRANSLATICA Dictionary

A dictionary used in a machine translation system has to be compatible with a computer algorithm.

As the development of entries in such a dictionary is laborious, a very careful selection of the words to be included in the dictionary becomes a prerequisite. In the course of the development of Polish-English translation by the POLENG team a number of computer, legal, economic and internet texts was assembled, from which the most frequent words and phrases were selected. Afterwards, the phrases were carefully annotated according to the rules of the translation system and incorporated in the TRANSLATICA dictionary. The source of vocabulary used in the English-Polish translation is the PWN-Oxford English-Polish Dictionary (a Polish abbreviation for the name is WSAP). The following versions of TRANSLATICA are to be based on the Polish-English PWN-Oxford dictionary (currently under construction - 2004). The WSAP dictionary was also used (after being reverseA
d) to supplement Polish-English dictionary in TRANSLATICA, the result being the greater accuracy of Polish-English entries. However, the greater accuracy of the dictionary does not entail a better quality of translation. In the authors' opinion, the quality of Polish-English translation is higher than the English-Polish one.


Grammar, Representation, and Syntax Analysis

The authors have developed their own formalism for the description of both grammar and transfer rules. The same formalism is used for both Polish-English and English-Polish translation, but the rules themselves differ. As a result, the translation process is irreversible: e.g. an attempt to translate a Polish text to English and then back to Polish will usually result in the original and the resulting Polish texts being different. The idea of reversible translation is tempting, but given the differences between languages it has not yet been implemented even for closely related languages.

In TRANSLATICA, the text is processed to the form of a phrase structure (see Text Representation in the section A few words about automatic translationIDH_ABOUT_MT). Syntactic analysis allows structures incongruent with the grammatical description (including language errors), and for each such construction a text representation is generated and transferred.


Some Interesting Issues in Translation

As Polish and English belong to different language families (Slavonic and Germanic respectively) even the simplest sentence constructions may differ.


Syntax Differences

Polish allows a relatively unrestrained variation in the order of sentence components (e.g. the verb often precedes the subject). English syntax is much more restrictive. Moreover, it is sometimes the case that the subject in a Polish sentence becomes the object in the English equivalent of that sentence, or the other way round. Additionally, a dummy subject may operate in Polish, whereas it does not occur in English. Let us consider a few examples:

Ty mi się wcale nie podobasz.
Ty nie podobasz się mi wcale.
Ty wcale nie podobasz się mi.
Ty wcale mi się nie podobasz.
Wcale mi się nie podobasz.
Mi się wcale nie podobasz. 
Mi się nie podobasz wcale.
Nie podobasz się mi wcale.

The English equivalent for all of those sentences is: I don't like you at all. And that is the translation produced by TRANSLATICA for any of the Polish sentences listed above.


Differences in the Meanings of Words

A Polish word may have a number of equivalents in English, and vice versa. The task of a machine translation system is to choose the most appropriate equivalent in a given context and in a given sentence. For instance, in TRANSLATICA dictionary the verb stop  has 20 different equivalents (nothing to say about noun meanings of the word). TRANSLATICA translation algorithm finds the most appropriate equivalent on the basis of a sentence structure analysis and the context of translation, as in:
The car stopped at lights. Samochód zatrzymał się na światłach.
The pain stopped when she had a cup of coffee. Ból ustał, gdy wypiła filiżankę kawy.
He stopped the hole with wax. Zatkał dziurę woskiem.
He wondered if the wind would stop. Zastanawiał się czy wiatr ustanie.
How to stop violence in the family? Jak powstrzymać przemoc w rodzinie?
The strike will stop the production. Strajk spowoduje przerwę w produkcji.
The judge has unfortunately stopped the trial. Sędzia niestety nie dopuścił do rozprawy.
In the southern regions of the country the electricity has been stopped. W południowych regionach kraju elektryczność została odcięta.
When he enters the room, the music will stop. Gdy on wejdzie do pokoju, muzyka ucichnie.
After 10 minutes he stopped smoking. Po 10 minutach przestał palić.
They stopped for a lunch in a nice restaurant. Zatrzymali się na lunch w ładnej restauracji.

Translating in Internet Explorer

Having integrated TRANSLATICA with Internet Explorer (by means of the Integrator), four additional icons appear on the toolbar:


Clicking on  initiates translation from Polish to English, whereas clicking on  initiates translation from English to Polish. The third icon enables the user to save a translated page on the computer (NOTE: using Internet Explorer function: File > Save would save the page before translation).
Click the button  to display the Settings window. The window allows for choosing the options of translation (see SettingsIDH_MENU_TRANSLATION_SETTINGS).
The translation process may take place both on-line (when the user is connected to the Internet) and off-line (when the user is disconnected from the Internet and the page is saved on the computer). In the translation mode, the screen is divided into two windows: the upper one contains the source of translation and the lower one contains the translated page. Every page that the user visits when following hyperlinks is translated. To quit the translation mode, toggle the translation button on the toolbar. Translation of a single page takes from a few seconds to over a minute (for complex pages).

Translating in Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox
When Mozilla is integrated with TRANSLATICA, the Mozilla toollbar contains three additional buttons:

Translation process is identical to that in Internet Explorer (see
Translation in Internet ExplorerIDH_MS_INTERNET_EXPLORER).  Mozilla allows for browsing a few documents by means of tabs (Ctrl-t opens a new tab). If Mozilla is integrated with TRANSLATICA, this feature makes it possible to browse a few pages together with their translations.
Mozilla is freely downloadable from: http://www.mozilla.org/start/1.7/*!EF(‘http://www.mozilla.org/start/1.7/’))

Translating in Outlook Express
If Outlook Express is integrated with TRANSLATICA, it is possible to translate both the received and composed messages. When a message is opened, three buttons are added: 

 () start translation into English or Polish respectively,  opens the Settings window (see SettingsIDH_MENU_TRANSLATION_SETTINGS).
The translated text appears as a new message. 

#$ K K
Translating in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word

With the integration of TRANSLATICA with MS Excel additional buttons appear in the toolbar and a Translatica option is added to the Tools menu. TRANSLATICA toolbar looks like this:



The buttons are linked to the following actions:

 - change the direction of translation;
 - Translate to a new document. This button creates a new document containing the translated text. If the user has not made any selection in the document the whole of it will be translated;
 - Translate within the original document. This button replaces the selected fragment with the translation. If the user has not made any selection the whole document will be translated.

In MS Excel, the user can also use the following options: clicking on one of the above two buttons while pressing Shift causes the translation of the current worksheet only; clicking on one of the above two buttons while pressing Ctrl initiates the translation of the current cell only.
 - Export to Translation Editor;
 - Import from Translation Editor;

Clicking on the button Export to Translation Editor will launch the TRANSLATICA Dic and feed the selection (or the whole) of the document to its source window. After that, the document can be translated and post-edited in the target window (e.g. variant equivalents may be adjusted). To retrieve the translated text back in the source application, click Import button in the source application.

 Options The button opens the Settings window (SettingsIDH_MENU_TRANSLATION_SETTINGS).

Translation in MS Word is analogous to the translation in MS Excel with the difference that the translation of individual worksheets or cells is not possible.


#$ K
Translating in Microsoft PowerPoint

Translation in MS PowerPoint is analogous to the translation in MS Excel with the difference that in Microsoft PowerPoint the user can translate individual slides. To do this, select View -> Slide Sorter from the menu bar, choose slides you want to translate and press the translation button. It is worth noting that objects embedded in MS Office documents are also translated, e.g. Excel charts in PowerPoint documents.



#$ K
Translating in Microsoft Outlook

In MS Outlook two new buttons are added, each corresponding to one direction of translation. You can translate one or more letters (to translate a group of letters select them from the appropriate folder and press the Translate button). You can find the translated letters in the Translated folder.

Translation Memory and Company Dictionary

Translation Memory stores a set of sentences that should be translated in a specific way – skipping the TRANSLATICA procedures. An exemplary application may be translation of forms where the names of the fields and some comments should be translated in the way required by the institution. Translation Memory may include practically unlimited number of sentences. If  a text to be translated includes a sentences from the Translation Memory, the process of automatic translation for this sentence is suspended, and the translation taken from Translation Memory is taken instead. It should be noted though, that the system does not browse Translation Memory in search of sentences similar to the one given – it searches only for exact matches.
Company Dictionary includes words and multiword phrases, which should be translated in a uniform way within the company, when they appear in any inflected form. For example, if a bank wishes to have the phrase pożyczka długoterminowa translated as long-period loan (rather than long-term loan as suggested by TRANSLATICA), all occurrences of any inflected form of this phrase in any sentence will be translated in that way.

To make it easier, sentences in Translation Memory and phrases in Company Dictionary are kept in one file, called Company Translation Database.
Company Translation Database consists of words, phrases and sentences in a source language together with their equivalents and the direction of translation. The file may be created in two formats: simple format, and XML format.

Simple format assumes subsequent lines to consist of the following elements separated by tab 
keys: 
IsPhrase	describes the entry as either a phrase which should be searched for in all inflected forms within the sentences (such an entry is the element of the Company Dictionary), or a sentence (the element of the Translation Memory). Possible values:
        yes (or tak or 1) for a phrase
        no (or nie or 1) for a sentence.

Direction 	describes the direction of the translation for the entry. Possible values:
       “>” – translation only from Polish into English
       “<” – translation only from English into Polish
       “<>” (or empty string) – translation in both directions

Phrase1	text in Polish 

Phrase2	text in English

Simple format can be easily obtained from an .xls file. If the elements of the entry description are given in consecutive columns, Simple is arrived at by using the Save as Text (separated by tab keys).

An exemplary file in Simple format:

no	<	Być, albo nie być – oto jest pytanie.	To be, or not to be: that is the question.
no	<>	Drogi Kliencie.	Dear customer.
yes	>	Biały Dom	White House

Company Traslation Database file in the XML format should be unified with the pattern included in the bin/win/enterprise_data.xsd file.

An exemplary file in XML file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<segments>
  <segment id="1" multiway="false”>
    <sentence lang="en">To be, or not to be: that is the question.</sentence>
    <sentence lang="pl" >Być, albo nie być – oto jest pytanie.</sentence>
  </segment>
  <segment id = “2” multiway="true">
    <sentence lang="pl">Drogi Kliencie.</sentence>
    <sentence lang="en">Dear customer.</sentence>
  </segment>
  <segment id="3" multiway="false”>
    <phrase lang="pl">Biały Dom</phrase>
    <phrase lang="en">White House</phrase>
  </segment>
</segments>

Batcher

TRANSLATICA allows for the use of batch processing of a number of MS Office files. To do that use the Batcher program, opened from the Start menu: Start -> Translatica Enterprise/Office+ -> Batcher.

 or 	Changes the direction of translation, the flag symbol stands for the target language.

Translate	Begins the translation process.

Cancel	Shuts down the program.

A tree showing the list of files to be translated is displayed in the main window of the Batcher program. Each of the files is associated with a application that opens it. Three types of documents are allowed: MS Word, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint. If an application of the MS Office package is not installed or has not been integrated, it is indicated by the symbol  next to the document.

After new files have been added, each one is displayed with a   or  icon, which represent the source language of the file.

Before the translation process is launched, a dialog window appears in which the user selects the destination folder for the translated files to be placed in.
After the translation process has been completed a symbol of the target language should appear next to each of the translated files. If a two-language symbol  or  has been displayed instead, it means that the translation of the file has failed. 

After the completion of the translation process, the location of each translated file is shown on the status bar.
