__Alignment__
 * other matching function: 
    * bi-grams, 
    * tri-grams,
    * synonyms 
 * other alignment methods: 
    * minimal crossing, 
    * stemming (using lt-proc to get the lemma(s)) [see lttoolbox/fst_processor.cc],
    * taking length of words,
    * taking formatting, 
    * taking POS into account, 

__Hypotheses Generation__
 * parallel scan,
 * chart-walk, 
 * better beam search (=> better scoring)

__General__
 * finish the pipeline and easy use,
 * tune for using > 2 engines
 * see if we cannot have the LM always loaded as a service that we query 
    (deadbeef?), for performance purposes.

__Collector__
 * Implement tokeniser / detokeniser for Moses

__Other__
 * make a ranker for randlm
 * document with Doxygen
