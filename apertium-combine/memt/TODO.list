__Alignment__
 * strategy patterns for *macthing function* and *words alignment*
 * other matching function: 
    * synonyms, 
    * bi-grams, 
    * tri-grams
 * other alignment methods: 
    * minimal crossing, 
    * taking POS into account, 
    * taking formatting, 
    * taking length of words

__Hypotheses Generation__
 * parallel scan,
 * chart-walk, 
 * better beam search (=> better scoring)

__General__
 * finish the pipeline and easy use,
 * tune for using > 2 engines
 * see if we cannot have the LM always loaded as a service that we query 
    (deadbeaf?), for performance purposes.
