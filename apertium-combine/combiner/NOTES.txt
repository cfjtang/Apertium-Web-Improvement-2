We should use the aligner of METEOR already doing Exact / Stemmer / Synonymy 
matching (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METEOR) if possible.
Main reasons are that:
 * each "one more" aligned word divide by (at least) 2 the combinatory 
explosion of hypotheses generation.
 * the hyp. generation would also provide better results, for instance
if "allowing" and "allow" are aligned thanks to the stemmer in ../test/wales*
