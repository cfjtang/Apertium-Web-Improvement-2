Review 1


> 6. “other systems supporting the languages”: what’s relevant if what language pairs they support. Which systems support this language pair?
I am not sure I understand what he meant.

> 8. “rules to tackle the problem”: CG rules can only reduce the problem, not solve it
Changed this to reduce...

> 10. “freely available” is used vaguely in more than one place in the paper. There should be a clear reference to the actual licenses, and to whether they are actually free/open-source or not
I'll add the references at the end.

> 14. Give an English equivalent for “digitalei rečnik na makedonskiot jazik”
"A digital dictionary of the Macedonian language"\footnote{Дигитален речник на македонскиот јазик}?

> 16. “ekavian and ijekavian dialects”: there are other dialects (‘ikavski’) but they are not used for any of the written standards. Perhaps they can just be seen as writing systems for the proto-yat sound. Give a reference to Serbo-Croatian dialects if possible. How do they correspond to "languages” in the Serbian–Croatian–Bosnian–Montenegrin set?
This has material for one more article :) Not all ekavian/ikavian is štokavian, and not all dialects are purely ekavian/ikavian. And štokavian ikavian usually does not share the lexis of the literary lang (none of the dialects do, in fact often (e/i)kavian imports terms with ijekavian yat without conversion). I dare not guess what happens in Serbia. Should I try writing a paragraph, or just put this somewhere on the slides?

> 17. “Macedonian dictionary”: weren’t interwiki links used?
Do I need to explain why they weren't used?

> 18. Disambiguation does not contain a statistical component which is standard in the workflow of many Apertium language pairs, and may be trained in at least two unsupervised ways (Baum-Welch, target-language-driven). Why weren’t they used after the application of the constraint grammar?
I simply explain this as "we had no reliable corpus to train it on"?

> 21. In the lexical transfer section, Montenegrin is not mentioned.
Explained, there is a footnote at the beginning saying we are waiting for the standardisation.

> 23. “avionom”: say that this case is the instrumental
What does he mean? It says "by aeroplane.INS"

> 26. Table 3: with such a small corpus it is superfluous to give so many decimals. I think just given full percents would probably be more faithful to the actual reliability of these measures.
Do you agree?

> 27. Table 3: explain the big difference in OOV between the first two articles and the last two article.
The first article is the one used in the midterm test, and the second one I think I was just eager to remove the unknown words.

> 28. “definite adjectives”: give an example of Serbo-Croatian adjectives in their definite and indefinite form for illustration and what their translations would look like in Macedonian
Will do this, though it's going to eat up space.

> 29. “free word order”: an important phenomenon which makes things even worse is discontinuous noun phrases (with intervening words) which I believe are possible in Serbo-Croatian, sometimes in connection with the use of the clitic “se”.
Who is this person :)? Yes, this is a killer for disambiguation especially. Do I need to mention an example of this as well?

> 30. “overall fine” has strange quotation marks around it
I will remove the quotation marks.

> 31. Define what a “morphological lexicon” is.
In a footnote is fine?

Reviewer 2:

> - In the "Disambiguation" section the rules are given directly in the Apertium syntax which may not be clear for everyone. I managed to guess the semantics of the rules from the explanations but still it is not very clear. A better explanation of the disambiguation rules with reference to the formal rules will help. For instance you can show examples in natural language like you did in the section for syntactic transfer.
This would REALLY eat space, should I do it?

> - It is surprising that both the monolingual and bilingual dictionaries (table 1) are quite small and still the reported coverage is above 70%. How should this be interpreted and what is the nature of the lexicons? Are the lexicons specifically build for the corpus that you have? If this is the case then will this generalize to other similar corpora? My guess is that the monolingual dictionaries include words that are mostly the same in both languages and for them you just need to transfer the morphological suffixes. Similarly the bilingual dictionary contains words whose stems are different in the different languages which means that the whole word needs to be replaced. If this is the case then it still deserves to be explained because this will explain the coverage. If my guess is wrong then it is even more important to explain the nature of the different lexicons.
I don't quite understand the comment.

> - Is it possible to include some baseline WER in the evaluation section? In this way it will be easier to see how much the system improves the translation, since the languages are mutually intelligible anyway.
This is the transliteration step you suggested. Will do in one of the next days. I just put it below all articles, and call it BASELINE, explaining somewhere how it was obtained?

Francis žeka:

Agrees, a ne modifies

<krvoje> how to "Avoid nested parentheses in references"
<spectie> use citep / citet / newcite / parcite / cite
<spectie> and play with them until you find one that works
<spectie> :)
<krvoje> :D
<krvoje> ok
<krvoje> Give an English equivalent for “Дигитален речник на македонскиот јазик”, "A digital dictionary of the Macedonian language"?
<krvoje> (disregard this one, I'm sending you a mail with a summary)
<spectie> ok
<spectie> "A digital dictionary of the Macedonian language"\footnote{Дигитален речник на македонскиот јазик}?
<spectie> i would do it the other way around
<krvoje> ok
<spectie> maceodnian in text, translation in footnote
<krvoje> yes, makes more sense
<spectie>
<spectie> This has material for one more article :) Not all ekavian/ikavian is štokavian, and not all dialects are purely ekavian/ikavian. And štokavian ikavian usually does not share the lexis of the literary lang (none of the dialects do, in fact often (e/i)kavian imports terms with ijekavian yat without conversion). I dare not guess what happens in Serbia. Should I try writing a paragraph, or just put this som
<spectie> ewhere on the slides?
<spectie>
<spectie> give a reference to wherre people can read about it in detail
<spectie> (e.g. friedman's BCS grmamar?)
<spectie> and then put it in the slides
<spectie>
<spectie> > 17. “Macedonian dictionary”: weren’t interwiki links used?
<spectie> Do I need to explain why they weren't used?
<spectie>
<spectie> didn't we use them ?
<krvoje> no
<spectie> ok
<spectie> > 18.

<spectie> I simply explain this as "we had no reliable corpus to train it on"?
<spectie>
<spectie> yes, as there is no reliable training corpus
<spectie> also, target-language-driven only supports 1-stage transfer
<krvoje> ah
<krvoje> ok
<krvoje> [at what time are you travelling, btw.?]
<spectie> so: "As there was no reliable, free training corpus, and the target-language based training of Sánchez et al. (...) only supports 1-stage transfer, we elected to instead just pick the first analysis"
<spectie> no idea yet
<spectie> i'll arrive on the 13th, leave on the 16th prolly
<krvoje> me2 probably
<krvoje> but in turkey
<krvoje> *to turkey
<spectie> aha, ok
<spectie> sunday, returning on the friday after
<krvoje> great, so there will be time to work on this afterwards
<spectie> "Who is this person :)?" haha
<krvoje> :)
<spectie> actually i know, but it wouldn't be anonymous if i told you
<spectie> if you ever meet him, you'll know immediately
<krvoje> yes, of course :)
<krvoje> haha
<spectie> > 26. Table 3: with such a small corpus it is superfluous to give so many decimals. I think just given full percents would probably be more faithful to the actual reliability of these measures.
<spectie> Do you agree?
<spectie>
<spectie> i can't remember what they looke dlik
<spectie> let me chekc
<spectie> > 26. Table 3: with such a small corpus it is superfluous to give so many decimals. I think just given full percents would probably be more faithful to the actual reliability of these measures.
<spectie> Do you agree?
<spectie>
<spectie> give 1 decimal point
<spectie> because that's the precision we have according to the standard deviation
<krvoje> ok
<spectie> > 27. Table 3: explain the big difference in OOV between the first two articles and the last two article.
<spectie> The first article is the one used in the midterm test, and the second one I think I was just eager to remove the unknown words.
<spectie>
<spectie> you can say that the idea was to get a measure of "ideal quality" and "practical quality"
<spectie> e.g. the ideal is if we have total coverage of the dictionaries, how do the disambiguation/transfer rules work?
<krvoje> ok great
<spectie> and practical quality is: if i threw a text in today, what should i expect ?
<spectie> > 28. “definite adjectives”: give an example of Serbo-Croatian adjectives in their definite and indefinite form for illustration and what their translations would look like in Macedonian
<spectie> Will do this, though it's going to eat up space.
<spectie>
<spectie> do this
<spectie> and don't care about space
<spectie>
<spectie> > 29. “free word order”: an important phenomenon which makes things even worse is discontinuous noun phrases (with intervening words) which I believe are possible in Serbo-Croatian, sometimes in connection with the use of the clitic “se”.
<spectie> Who is this person :)? Yes, this is a killer for disambiguation especially. Do I need to mention an example of this as well?
<spectie>
<spectie> maybe this could be described ?
<spectie>
<spectie> > 31. Define what a “morphological lexicon” is.
<spectie> In a footnote is fine?
<spectie>
<spectie> footnote is fine
<spectie>
<spectie> > - Is it possible to include some baseline WER in the evaluation section? In this way it will be easier to see how much the system improves the translation, since the languages are mutually intelligible anyway.
<spectie> This is the transliteration step you suggested. Will do in one of the next days. I just put it below all articles, and call it BASELINE, explaining somewhere how it was obtained?
<spectie>
<spectie> don't put it below, put it by the side
<krvoje> ah ok
<spectie> e.g. "Translit." | "WER" | "PER"
<spectie>
<spectie> > - It is surprising that both the monolingual and bilingual dictionaries (table 1) are quite small and still the reported coverage is above 70%.

<spectie> I don't quite understand the comment.
<spectie>
<spectie> it's difficult to understand what he wants to say here
<spectie> but the Wikipedia vs. SETimes numbers should give an idea
<spectie> a couple of points:
<spectie> * where you have apertium-sh-mk, put {\small {\tt apertium-sh-mk}}
<spectie> for the glosses, use {\smallcaps n.neut}
<spectie> in the CG ruls, use 'Prep' not 'Preposition'
<krvoje> for 29., I can think of some perverse example for this, the one that's in the article is from the corpus
<spectie> whre is it in the paper ?
<krvoje> Common problems, last par
<spectie>
<spectie>    Both languages have a very free word order. For instance, an ad-
<spectie> jective can modify a noun arbitrarily far to the left (Voˇnja.N.FEM
<spectie>                                                          z
<spectie> zrakoplovom ... bila je odluˇuju ́a.ADJ.FEM → Возенjе.N.NEUT со
<spectie>                             c c
<spectie> авионот ... беше решавачка.ADJ.FEM [The airplane ride ... was de-
<spectie> cisive])
<spectie>
<spectie> ooh
<spectie> i'm not sure i'd call this "modify"
<krvoje> uf, ok
<spectie> because it is joined with a copula
<spectie> if you have "The cat is red"
<spectie> does "red" modify cat ?
<spectie> it definitely "agrees"
<krvoje> so I put "agree"?
<spectie> "an adjective can agree with a noun ..."
<krvoje> Vožnja becomes Vozenje so "bila je odlučujuća" should become "bilo je odlučujuće" => "беше решавачко"
<krvoje> ok
<spectie> yeah
<spectie> and here i would say "Both languages have very free order of the main constituents"
<spectie> i don't like saying "free word order"
<spectie> because the word order isn't free
<krvoje> ok :)
<spectie> in fact, many things are fixed
<spectie> you can't put prepositions after
<spectie> or relatives
<krvoje> yea
<spectie> you can't say for example "There walking man who father my is."
<krvoje> in croatian?
<spectie> yeah
<krvoje> well you almost can :)
<krvoje> Tamo hoda čovjek koji otac moj je!
<spectie> e.g. čovek, ktori idu tam, je moj otec.
<krvoje> I you want to be poetic as shit
<spectie> haha
<krvoje> but then it means "there walks the man who is my father"
<spectie> "The man walking there is my father"
<spectie> is what i was trying to say
<spectie> anyway
<krvoje> yes, there some stuff that arent free
<krvoje> and for discont NP's actually difficult to think of something other than like "Moja se majka zove Marija"
<krvoje> where 'se' goes after the 1st word
<spectie> my girlfriend is called Marija ?
<krvoje> mother :)
<spectie> bah
<spectie> ok
<spectie> that's weird
<krvoje> you can do evil things like "On se, ...evil phrase..., pogledao u ogledalo"
<spectie> what does the 'se' go there!
<spectie> pogledao u ogledalo = saw and understood
<spectie> ?
<krvoje> looked at himself in the mirror
<spectie> hahaha
<spectie> ok
<spectie> zerkalo
<krvoje> google translate, begone :)
<krvoje> zerkalo :)
<krvoje> like something that gawks at you :)
<spectie> lol
<krvoje> would be "zirka"
<krvoje> (the se pairs up with the rfx verb, but it lingers at after the 1st constituent of the phrase)
<spectie> after all ?
<spectie> eg. numerals and adjectives too?
<krvoje> yes
<spectie> weird
<krvoje> Jedan se čovjek pogledao u ogledalo
<krvoje> Ružni se čovjek ...
<krvoje> i think the order of clitics is 1st constituent dative accusative reflexive
<krvoje> You can also say Jedan čovjek se pogledao...
<spectie> hmmmm
<krvoje> what would a discontinuous noun phrase be? what words can be the constituents?
<spectie> well, this case, the "se" is not part of the noun phrase
<spectie> because it modifies the verb, not the head of the NP
<krvoje> ok
<krvoje> On mu<clt> ga<clt> se<clt><rfx> nije usudio dati
<krvoje> you can do this but no, this is a verb phrase, nevermind
<krvoje> Prvi<num> mu ga se čovjek<n> nije usudio dati
<krvoje> This is stretching it a bit, but it's literary. It's not terribly discontinuous
<spectie> you've got a load of clitics bang in the middle of your NP
<spectie> it's fairly discontinuou
<spectie> s
<krvoje> [I think] it's matched in transfer, since it has a max length. should i put an example of it?
<spectie> hmm, do you do that ?
<spectie> i might do it in a preliminary transfer to put the clitics before the first constitutent
<krvoje> i think this particular example is not covered, but we have rules for clitic reordering, since mk has a different system for it
<spectie> ok
