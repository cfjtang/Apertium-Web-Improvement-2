\subsection{Transfer}

The BCMS and Slovene languages are very closely related, and their
morphologies are extremely similar. Most of non-technical transfer
rules are thus written only for rare syntactic differences. These are
mostly about clitic ordering, and different noun case usage.

Following are examples of transfer rules, which also illustrate some
contrastive characteristics of the languages:

\begin{itemize}
\item The future tense:
\enumsentence{

Ja ću gledati\footnote{The encliticised future tense forms (gledat ću / gledaću) are handled equally.} $\rightarrow$ Jas bom gledal

[I] [will{\sc.clt.p1.sg}] [watch{\sc.inf}] $\rightarrow$ [I] [will{\sc.clt}] [watch{\sc.pres.p1.sg}]

(I will watch.)
}
\end{itemize}
