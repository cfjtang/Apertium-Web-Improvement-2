\section{Future work}

improve coverage, disambiguation (esp. for slv) and transfer rules

work on more Slavic language pairs (e.g. hbs-rus)

backport improvements in the HBS components to hbs-mak

keep up-to-date with latest politico-linguistic developments. Add in
 Montenegrin when the standard is agreed on.
