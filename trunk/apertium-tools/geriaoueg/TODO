* Split out config into a config file that is just included ?
* Decide on a standard format for bidix entries.
* Make CSS boxes prettier (like the javascript ones?)
* Fix encoding problems (latin1 with some sites)
* Give an option for "full machine translation" if available"
  -- Would be nice to be able to toggle switch between "vocab" and MT
