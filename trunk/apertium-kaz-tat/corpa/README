* corpus.kaz.txt
	All stories and texts I have been working so far.

* corpus.kaz-tat.postedit.txt
	The name explains what it is.

* origina_traduko.txt
	Translation of corpus.kaz.txt with the second to last revision of apertium-kaz-tat.

* nova_traduko.txt
	Translation of corpus.kaz.txt with the last revision of apertium-kaz-tat.


------

Basic workflow is like the following (IS talking to himself):
	1) run diff on origina_traduko.txt and corpus.kaz-tat.postedit.txt,
	2) see what is to fix/to improve,
	3) fix them,
	4) run testcorpus.sh to see whether you really fixed them,
	5) commit,
	6) mv nova_traduko.txt origina_traduko.txt
	
	repeat the cycle

testcorpus.sh script in apertium-kaz-tat/ gives a coloured diff of "origina" and
"nova" translations.
