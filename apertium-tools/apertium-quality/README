== Setup ==
Installation is very, very easy.

To install by default to /usr/local, as root:
# ./autogen.sh

That's it!

=== Rootless Installation === 
For a rootless, prefixed installation:
$ ./autogen.sh PREFIX=/path/to/prefix prefixed

=== Standalone scripts ===
If you wish to generate scripts for use elsewhere without using the libraries, then:
$ ./autogen.sh standalone

This will create a dist/ directory containing the scripts.

### THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED ###

== Extra Options ==
PREFIX: sets the prefix to be installed to
PYTHON: the Python binary to use for installation
