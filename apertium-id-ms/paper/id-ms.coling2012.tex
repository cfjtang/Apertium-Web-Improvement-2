We describe the development of a bidirectional machine translation system between Indonesian and Malaysian, two closely related Austronesian languages widely spoken by 180 million speakers around the world. The system is based on the re-use of free and publicly available resources, such as the Apertium machine translation platform and Wikipedia. We also present our approaches to overcome the data scarcity problems in both languages by exploiting the morphology similarities between the two.}

\section{Introduction}

\section{System}
The system is based on the Apertium machine translation platform \citep{apertium/2011}.\footnote{\url{http://www.apertium.org/}} The platform was originally aimed at the Romance languages of the Iberian peninsula, but has also been adapted for other, more distantly related language pairs. The whole platform, both programs and data, are licensed under the Free Software Foundation's General Public Licence\footnote{\url{http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html}} (GPL) and all the software and data for the 33 supported language pairs (and the other pairs being worked on) is available for download from the project website.

\subsection{Architecture of the system}

\begin{figure*}[htbp]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{architecture.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The pipeline architecture of the Apertium system.}
\label{fig:modules}
\end{figure*}

The Apertium translation engine consists of a Unix-style \emph{pipeline} or
\emph{assembly line} with the following modules (see Fig.~\ref{fig:modules}):  
\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{deformatter} which encapsulates the format information
 in the input as \emph{superblanks} that will then be seen
 as blanks between words by the other modules.
\item A \emph{morphological analyser} which segments the text in
  surface forms (SF) (\emph{words}, or, where detected, multi-word lexical
  units or MWLUs) and for each, delivers one or more \emph{lexical
    forms} (LF) consisting of \emph{lemma}, \emph{lexical category} and
  morphological information. 
\item A \emph{morphological disambiguator} (constraint grammar) which chooses, using linguistic rules
  the most adequate sequence of morphological analyses for an ambiguous sentence. 
\item A \emph{lexical transfer} module which reads each SL LF 
  and delivers the corresponding target-language (TL) LF
  by looking it up in a bilingual dictionary encoded as an FST
  compiled from the corresponding XML file. The lexical transfer module may
  return more than one TL LF for a single SL LF.
\item A \emph{lexical selection} module which chooses, based on context 
  rules the most adequate translation of ambiguous source language LFs.
\item A \emph{structural transfer} module which
    performs local syntactic operations, is compiled from XML files containing rules that 
    associate an \emph{action} to each defined LF \emph{pattern}. Patterns are applied left-to-right, and the 
    longest matching pattern is always selected.
\item A \emph{morphological generator} which delivers a TL SF
 for each TL LF, by suitably inflecting it. 
\item A \emph{reformatter} which de-encapsulates any format
  information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Morphological transducers}
There is one publicly available morphological tool for Indonesian, namely MorphInd \citep{larasati2011indonesian}. However, MorphInd is only designed for analysis, while we wanted the dictionary to be able to be used for both morphological analysis and generation. Moreover, there are rarely linguistic resources and tools available for Malaysian language. \citet{Baldwin06opensource} has developed a free/open-source lemmatiser for Malay, but this does not meet our need either since we wanted to include other important morphological information in our Malaysian transducer, such as parts of speech and affixes. Thus, we decided to build the morphological transducers from scratch.

Similar to most Apertium language pairs, the morphological transducers for both Indonesian and Malaysian are constructed using \emph{lttoolbox}, a toolbox for morphological analysis and generation that is available under free/open-source licence. The monolingual dictionary for each language is provided as XML-formatted entries, which is then compiled into a fast finite state transducers using the toolbox.

\subsubsection{Indonesian morphological transducer}
The words were added semi-automatically to the Indonesian morphological analyser based on frequency, with the most frequent words being added first. The frequency list was taken from a database dump of the Indonesian Wikipedia. For each word in the frequency list, we obtained its lemma and part of speech information from Kateglo\footnote{\url{http://kateglo.bahtera.org/}}, an online Indonesian dictionary with over 70,000 entries licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\footnote{\url{http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/}}. Since we also wanted to include affix information in our analyser, we wrote a rule-based morpheme separator to decompose a given Indonesian surface form into their constituent morphemes, also by making use of the lemma information from Kateglo. Moreover, closed classes (e.g. pronouns, conjunctions) were added by hand.

\subsubsection{Malaysian morphological transducer}
A frequency list for Malaysian was also created based on a database dump of the Malaysian Wikipedia. Unlike Indonesian, we barely found a comprehensive Malaysian dictionary with adequate morphological information, such as lemma and part of speech. Hence, the Malaysian analyser was built using the two strategies below.

First, Malaysian words that also exist as an Indonesian word were assumed to share the same morphological information (i.e. the same lemma and part of speech), and added automatically to the analyser. Although this method may introduce a number of false friends (e.g. \emph{polisi} means `policy' in Malay but `police' in Indonesian), the benefit outweighs the risk since there is huge overlap in the lexicons of the two languages. Moreover, most of these false friends usually belong to the same part of speech.

Second, we also added Malaysian words which appear in our bilingual lexicon. Since every entry in a bilingual lexicon is a pair of words with the same meaning, we can assume that these words also belong to the same part of speech most of the time. Our approaches to building the bilingual dictionary are presented in the following section.

\subsection{Bilingual dictionary}
There is no freely available bilingual dictionary between Indonesian and Malaysian, so we had to build the dictionary from scratch. At the moment, the bilingual dictionary contains 12,142 entries, which was developed in several ways described below.

First, most of the entries were added using automatic word alignments. We created an Indonesian-Malaysian parallel corpus by translating many articles taken from Malaysian Wikipedia. The translation process is mostly automatic, with the help of existing Malaysian-Indonesian machine translation system such as Google Translate.\footnote{\url{http://translate.google.com/}}

Next the Wikipedia corpus is tagged using our morphological analyser, and word alignments were created by running \texttt{Giza++} \citep{Och2003align} on the tagged corpus. We fed the probabilistic dictionary into the \texttt{ReTraTos} toolbox \citep{Caseli2006retratos}, which extracts both phrases and single-word translations from alignments, and converts them into Apertium translation entries. The \texttt{ReTraTos} method gave us about 12,000 translation entries, but also required a manual check due the amount of noise in the resulting data.

Finally, some entries were added manually, which included closed classes and words that frequently appeared in Wikipedia but were not yet added to the bilingual dictionary.

\subsection{Disambiguation}
The output from the morphological analysis is disambiguated using Apertium's statistical disambiguator module. The module implements a bigram part-of-speech tagger based on hidden Markov models (HMM). To improve the accuracy of our disambiguator, a Constraint Grammar \citep{Karlsson1990cg} could be used as a pre-disambiguator module before feeding the input to the HMM, which is left for future work.

\subsection{Lexical selection rules}
Given the closeness of the languages, lexical selection is not a large problem between Indonesian and Malaysian. However, a number of rules can be written for ambiguous words; for example, the Malaysian preposition \emph{daripada} `from (to explain the origin of something), than (comparison)' can be translated into Indonesian as either \emph{dari} `from' or \emph{daripada} `than (comparison)', depending on the surrounding context.

Another example is the copulas \emph{adalah} and \emph{ialah} (both meaning `be'), which exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian, but have a slightly different usage in each language. In Malaysian, \emph{adalah} is used before an adjective phrase or a prepositional phrase and \emph{ialah} is used only before a noun phrase. In comparison to Indonesian, there are no strict rules governing the use of the two words, and their usage is more interchangeable.
\subsection{Transfer rules}
There are barely differences between the grammar of Indonesian and Malaysian, in that the structure of words, phrases, clauses, and sentences are almost exactly the same. That said, the lexical transfer between the two languages works by simple word substitution in most cases.

\subsection{General information}
This template continues as if the "other language" option had been chosen, meaning that the article proper, in English, begins on page 4. Its length corresponds to that of a short paper.

USUAL but IMPORTANT: papers must conform to the official COLING-2012 style guidelines (downloadable from the website).

Submission and reviewing will be on-line, managed by the START system. The only accepted format for submitted papers is PDF. Supplementary material, if any, in the form of tools or resources, must be in the form of a single .zip or a .tgz archive file with a maximum size of 10MB; otherwise there are no constraints on its format. Submissions, together with all supplementary material, must be uploaded on the START system by the submission deadlines; submissions after that time will not be reviewed.

To minimize network congestion, we request authors to upload their submissions as early as possible (especially if they contain large supplementary material files). Improved versions of the submissions may be uploaded until the deadline.

Submissions must be in the format described in this template. If for some reason you have a problem producing this format, please contact organisers as early as possible. Organisers reserve the right not to publish papers not conforming to the required format.

On acceptance of a submission, precise instructions will be given on how to send the camera ready version, and in some cases with required modifications. Camera ready versions not conforming to programme committee’s improvement requests will be considered as unsent, and hence will not be presented at the conference and will not be included in the proceedings.
% subsection 2.2
\subsection{More on the format of submissions}
Since several years, scientific conferences have been distributing proceedings on electronic media to avoid producing printed versions. Printed versions are given to only those participants who explicitly request and pay for them. Most participants get the proceedings on a CD or on a USB key. That is a very good idea, but the drawback is that very few participants manage to read more than a small number of papers, typically less than 1/10th or 1/20th of the number available in the proceedings. The main reason seems to be that is it very awkward to read traditional A4 sized portrait double-column articles on usual laptop screens. 

The recent JEP-TALN-RECITAL-2012 conferences have successfully addressed that problem by proposing a template that is optimised for reading on PC screens. COLING-2012 and associated events propose to use it, with the option of using the Times New Roman font for authors having problems with installing the slightly better fonts Charter, Charis, or Georgia.

\subsubsection{Document format\& character fonts}
\emph{Submissions will be in PDF, with page dimensions of 150 mm x 210 mm, and margins of 5 mm on all sides.} That corresponds to A5 (148.2 mm x 209.9 mm) with 4.1 mm horizontal margins and 5 mm vertical margins.  To get the same layout on an A4 format while preparing a submission, choose A4 and put the margins at 35 mm (horizontal) and 48.3 mm (vertical).
\newpage
\emph{No header or footer should be present in submissions.}

The \emph{preferred fonts} have been chosen because they are optimised for reading on screen while being elegant in print. If possible, submissions prepared with LaTeX should use the \emph{Charter (Bitstream)} font. Users of Word or LibreOffice should use an equivalent font, namely (in order of preference):
\begin{compactenum}
\item\emph{Charter} (via Bitstream), available on most Linux and in LaTeX \emph{texlive} installations.
\item\emph{Charis SIL} (via SIL). It is an extension of the Charter font, and is available at \href{http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=CharisSIL_download}
{http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item\_id=CharisSIL\_download}); 
\item\emph{Georgia.} This font is included  in MS Word by default.
\end{compactenum} 
If authors encounter problems in installing one of the preferred fonts, they should use Times New Roman (available in all platforms) as default font, with the same point sizes.

\emph{The body of the text should be in size 10pt, the titles in bold 11pt for levels 1 \& 2, and 10pt from level 3 onwards.}
%2.2.2
\subsubsection{Pages and paragraphs}
Paragraphs use single spacing and are justified left and right. They are not indented, but are separated by a half-line vertical space (6pt above and below).

The first page contains only the title, the names and affiliations of authors, the abstract(s) and the keywords (see page 1 of this template).

The body of the paper, including the introduction, begins on page 4 if a condensed (2-page) synopsis in another language L$_{2}$ is included, and on page 2 otherwise. 

A LaTeX stylesheet, a Word template, and an ODT template are available on the COLING-2012 website. Submissions will be handled interactively under SoftConf. 
%2.2.3
\subsubsection{Submission sizes}
Here are the length limits according to the type of submission. "Any number of reference pages" means that pages used for bibliographical and Internet references are not counted in the page number limits. However, it stands to reason that reviewers will accept only reasonable sizes.\\\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
full papers & 14 A5 pages with any number of reference pages & Oral presentation\\
\hline
short papers & 8 A5 pages with any number of reference pages & Poster presentation\\
\hline
demo papers & 6 A5 pages with any number of reference pages & Demonstration\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\

Papers are in English. However, if an author so wishes s/he may add elements in another language (L$_{2}$): a title, an abstract and keywords on the first page, and 2 pages (a synopsis) in L$_{2}$, beginning on page 2. Such papers will have 14+2 (or 8+2, or 6+2) pages, plus any number of pages for reference. 
%2.3
\subsection{Other formatting elements}
%2.3.1	
\subsubsection{Lists}
Here is a bulleted list, where each element begins with an independent sentence (capitalized).
\begin{compactitem}
\item Its lines are separated by less vertical space than normal paragraphs.
\item We don’t add space between paragraphs of that same style.
\end{compactitem}

Here is a numbered list of items that are parts of an outside sentence. Take care to:
\begin{compactenum}
\item restart the numbering and get the numbers consecutive. 
\item not to capitalize the initial letter of such items.
\end{compactenum}
%2.3.2
\subsubsection{Figures and tables}
Figures and tables will be centered on the page, with a caption underneath. The caption will contain the keyword \textsc{Figure} or \textsc{Table} in small capitals, followed by the number of the figure or table. Numbers in each category are independent. Examples appear in this template. Equations and formulae may appear in line or centered on the page, without captions. A reference number may appear to the right of a formula or an equation.

\begin{table}[!h]
\setcounter{table}{0}
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|p{5cm}|}
	\hline
	A table&\\
	\hline
	&The table is centered. Its cells may be optionally centered. Avoid full justification leading to very long horizontal spaces.\\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
\caption{A table caption appears under it.}\label{Table}
\end{table}
%2.3.3
\subsubsection{Notes and references}
Footnotes\footnote{Here is one!} can be used.

References to the bibliography, for example \cite{Bernhard07}, are formatted with the APA style (see \href{http://www.apastyle.org/}{http://www.apastyle.org/}). It is available in all the LaTeX installations based on \emph{texlive} and on CTAN.

Users of Word or LibreOffice are encouraged to follow this style as much as possible when using their bibliography management tool (Mendeley, Zotero or Endnote). They can refer to the example below. Authors citing online references (URLs) should include the creation date in the reference.

The rest of this document only illustrates the format described above.
