\subsection{Disambiguation}
Though for both languages there exists a number of tools for
morphological taggin and disambiguation (\todo{reference some}), there
are none freely available. Likewise, the adequatly tagged corpora are
mostly non-free (\todo{reference some non-free corpora, like
  1984.,...}). \todo{See on the taggers/corpora for Slovene}\todo{See
  on the taggers/corpora for BCMS}.
Since both BCMS Slovene are highly flective languages, the
automatically trained tagger would be inefficient blabla, we chose to omit the
statistical tagger canonically used in Apertium language pairs, and
use solely Constraint Gramar (CG) for disambiguation. The CG module
does not provide complete disambiguation, so in the case of any
remaining ambiguity the system picks the first output analysis.
